# Advent of code 2021!

You can find all the info related to this challenge in the [official webpage](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Run TypeScript solutions

To run TypeScript solutions, **open a terminal in the `typescript` directory**, and run `yarn` command to install the necessary dependencies. Then, you can just run any of the examples using the `run-solution`, script, for example:

```bash
yarn run-solution ./day1/reduce_solution.ts
```

NOTE: By the moment I'll be implementing just naive solutions, meaning I'll get direct to the point. In the future, I'll think about the possibility of implementing all the problems using more elegant solutions.

## Run Rust solutions

WIP...

As a exercise, I'll try to solve all the problems using Rust, language I'm learning right now. I won't be my number one priority, but in the future I'll solve all the problems using Rust. I promise.
