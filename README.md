## Run TypeScript solutions

To run TypeScript solutions, **open a terminal in the `typescript` directory**, and run `yarn` command to install the necessary dependencies. Then, you can just run any of the examples using the `run-solution`, script, for example:

```bash
yarn run-solution ./day1/reduce_solution.ts
```
